  <p class="paragraph">It can be extremely hard to find time to read these days. With our lives cluttered with work, school, life, and new amazing episodes of Game of Thrones and all of these new movies…..who has time to read? I have a stack of books waiting for me in my “to be read” pile.

    Don’t get me wrong. I absolutely love reading. I’m the one that often tries to convince friends to read. I tell them all of the amazing benefits of reading. For example, did you know that reading makes you more empathetic? It can even decrease the likelihood of Alzheimer’s disease. I’ve been an avid reader since I was a little kid and can say that reading made a big impact on my life.
    
    We just live in a world with so many distractions and obligations. And that’s why I like very short stories. Stories that are so short that you can finish them in a single sitting, short enough to finish while you’re waiting in line at the grocery store.
    
    I was always hesitant to try short stories because I like character development and story depth. I’ve found, however, that great short stories can be extremely addictive and fun. There are a number of stories where I’ve fallen in love with the characters (more than I care to admit) despite the short length. I’ve even shed a tear or 2 (or 100).
    
    Here are some of the very best short stories. Many are very addictive. Many are very short. And all of them you can enjoy on your mobile device online. In addition to these recommendations, for really great short stories, I’d also recommend checking out Commaful.
    
    1. The Mountain
    I ended up drenched in tears after reading this. Make you sure you have a tissue box handy. This one sucks you in and really hits you in the gut. Such a cute and well-written story that will get your emotions in a bunch. Hold on for the next 5 minutes of great storytelling.
    
    2. The Escaped Man
    I read a lot of thrillers so it’s really difficult to catch me off-guard. Somehow this one caught me with a plot twist. I thought I knew what was going on and BAM I was discombobulated and surprised with that masterpiece of an ending. Seriously amazing.
    
    3. I Can’t Believe You’re Mine
    A super cute romance story that is simply a lot of fun to read. Reading this will leave you warm and fuzzy inside. Such great imagery and cute storytelling.
    
    4. Don’t Let Me Fall In Love With You
    I generally do not like 4th wall stories. Most are gimmicky and fake. Many don’t use the form factor well and the story would be better off being told as a normal story. This story, however, is a very well done example of breaking the 4th wall. If you let your imagination flow while reading this, you’ll feel raw emotions start to form. It’s a quick read and you’ll really feel it!
    
    5. I Didn’t Know What I Was Missing
    The fact that this story is a true story (from what it seems) makes it that much more powerful. It’s an empowering story and a story that ends with a heartwarming ending. It makes you want to believe in love.</p>
